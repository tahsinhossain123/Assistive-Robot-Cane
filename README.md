# Assistive Robot Cane ðŸ¤–ðŸ¦¯

## Overview
The Assistive Robot Cane is a smart assistive tool designed for individuals with visual impairments. By leveraging the Robot Operating System (ROS) framework, the cane is able to actively sense its environment and compute optimal paths, ensuring the user is guided safely to their destination while dynamically avoiding obstacles.

## Inspiration & Workshop Experience ðŸ’¡

Our journey began with an enlightening session with Professor Tapomayukh Bhattacharjee, a pioneer in the field of assistive technology at Cornell University. The insights from Professor Bhattacharjee and the innovative work showcased by his lab on mobility aids were truly inspiring. 

During a week-long summer workshop at Cornell University, my team and I embarked on this ambitious project. This setting provided a perfect blend of academic rigor and collaborative spirit.

We gained a comprehensive understanding of the Robot Operating System (ROS) framework, diving deep into topics like perception, motion planning, and control. The knowledge and technological advancements we were exposed to at Cornell were foundational in the development of the Assistive Robot Cane.

## Our Journey ðŸš€

From concept to prototype, our journey of designing the Robot Cane was both challenging and fulfilling. The final product stands as a testament to the transformative potential of robotics in enhancing the quality of life for many.

Key capabilities of the cane include:
- Real-time environmental sensing.
- Efficient and safe path computation.
- Dynamic obstacle detection and avoidance.

## Conclusion ðŸŒŸ

This project was not only a technical challenge but a heartwarming experience. We believe in the potential of such innovations to make a meaningful difference in the world, especially for those with disabilities.
